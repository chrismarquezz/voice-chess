# VoiceChess

A voice-controlled chess application built with SwiftUI and Speech Recognition APIs that lets players make every move via voice instead of touch. The game processes spoken commands like "e4" or "knight to f3," validates them against the rules of chess, and updates the board in real time. By combining natural voice input with a visual chessboard, it creates a hands-free and accessible way to play chess.

## Features
- Speak moves like `e4`, `Kf3`, etc.
- Chess rules enforced
- Interactive chessboard UI

## Tech Stack
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- `SFSpeechRecognizer` (Apple Speech Recognition API)
